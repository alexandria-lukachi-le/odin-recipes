    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut potatoes then add to lightly salted water. Boil potatoes till fork tender.</li>
            <li>Prepare ground beef and onion mixture while the potatoes boil. Add a tablespoon of oil to a frying pan, set heat to medium high. Then add diced onion and cook till translucent.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef to frying pan with onion, season with seasoning salt and black pepper. Stir the mixture occasionally till fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are done, drain and add to a large bowl. Mash potatoes thoroughly. Add butter, milk, seasoning, and ground beef/onion mixture. Combine.</li>
            <li>Place the mixture from the previous step into the fridge for half an hour to set up. Then take out of the fridge to form into around 3 inch oval patties half an inch thick.</li>
            <li>After forming all of your patties, you'll then coat in flour, then beaten egg, and finally in panko breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>At this point they are ready to fry until golden brown in vegetable oil and can then be enjoyed after cooling for about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
