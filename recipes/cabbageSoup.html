        <ol>Cut the cabbage into any shape you like, whether it be stripes or squares as long as its bite size.</ol>
        <ol>After prepping the cabbage, ina large pot add your ground pork and season with salt, pepper, fish sauce, and mushroom powder.</ol>
        <ol>Bring the pot to medium-high heat and mix up and break up the ground pork as it browns. When cooked through add your chopped cabbage to the pot.</ol>
