        <li>Cut the cabbage into any shape you like, whether it be stripes or squares as long as its bite size.</li>
        <li>After prepping the cabbage, ina large pot add your ground pork and season with salt, pepper, fish sauce, and mushroom powder.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to medium-high heat and mix up and break up the ground pork as it browns. When cooked through add your chopped cabbage to the pot.</li>
        <li>Fill the pot with water till everything is submerged(the cabbage might float, that's okay just leave some clearance at the top of the pot.)</li>
        <li>Season the soup with same seasonings as the pork, salt, pepper, fish sauce, and mushroom powder to taste. Bring the soup to a boil then cover with a lid and reduce the heat to a simmer.</li>
        <li>After half an hour or until the cabbage is soft, the soup is ready to be served! Optionally can be enjoyed with steamed jasmine white rice.</li>
